% OPEN_ROBO_SIMULATOR MATLAB code for Open_Robo_Simulator.fig
%      OPEN_ROBO_SIMULATOR, by itself, creates a new OPEN_ROBO_SIMULATOR or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = OPEN_ROBO_SIMULATOR returns the handle to a new OPEN_ROBO_SIMULATOR or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      OPEN_ROBO_SIMULATOR('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in OPEN_ROBO_SIMULATOR.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      OPEN_ROBO_SIMULATOR('Property','Value',...) creates a new OPEN_ROBO_SIMULATOR or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Open_Robo_Simulator_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Open_Robo_Simulator_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
